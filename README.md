# General Plasma Physics Lectures Notes



These notes summarize and explain the topics covered in a graduate-level introductory plasma physics course at Princeton University (General Plasma Physics I, Fall 2017). I first define what a plasma is and introduce some of its basic properties. I then discuss single particle motion, kinetic and fluid models of plasmas, and plasma waves.
